        <p>Blood donation is a voluntary procedure that can help save lives. There are several types of blood donation. Each type
        helps meet different medical needs.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Whole blood donation is the most common type of blood donation. During this donation, you donate about a pint (about
        half a liter) of whole blood. The blood is then separated into its components â€” red cells, plasma and sometimes
        platelets.</p>
